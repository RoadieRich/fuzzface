#Fuzzy Time


Fuzzy Time is a watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com).

Normally, it shows the time to the nearest whole five minutes - does anyone really care if it's 23 or 24 minutes past the hour, or just that it's twenty five past?  Because the screen only needs updating every five minutes, it extends the battery life, too.

You can shake or tap the watch to show the exact time (to the nearest minute, if you're worried about seconds look elsewhere), If, for some strange reason, you need to be that accurate.  

You can download the binary from the [Rebble app store](https://apps.rebble.io/applications/54888ca1f3bdd511e40000a8).
